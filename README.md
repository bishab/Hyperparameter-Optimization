# Hello!
## Do you like Harry Potter?
<i><b> Well, if your answer is yes, I am going to tell you a story, if it is no, you still will be getting the code in a sound wayðŸ˜‰</i><br>
I had to use a supervised learning algorithm for classifying whether the mushroom Hagrid brought to Hogwarts is edible or poisonous. <br>

<br><br>
Professor asked me if there are any spells for that or not.<br>
I sought help from Hermoine, like every other day, she could tell me the spell but still could not teach me the correct way I should hold the Magic Wand!<br>
I was in despair- it almost consumed my Quidditch time. I would not be able to play it for the next five days. FIVE DAYS!!!
<br>
I was in search of someone who could really teach me to hold the wand and help me predict........<br>
<b>Tom Riddle helped me- cause he's the one who could handle python the best way.ðŸŽ‡ðŸŽ‡</b>

Here's how he taught me all this!<b>
(Hope you consider the algorithm as a spell and hyperparams as magic wand)<b>

Let me show you how I managed to tell Professor Dumbledoor that it was an edible mushroom, not the cursed one.</b>


<i>Hogwarts was happy again!</i>
